            At Umang Living, we are building more than homes—we are building
            India’s most joyful and connected senior communities. As we expand
            across 75+ cities, we invite passionate partners to join our mission
            of redefining life after 55. Whether you’re a financer, real estate
            developer, senior club, or NGO working with elders—together, we can
            create vibrant spaces where seniors thrive in dignity, care, and
            community.
